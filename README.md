![seQuencing logo](SequencingLogo/sequencing-logo.svg)

This repo is a place for users of the [sequencing](https://github.com/sequencing-dev/sequencing)
package to share examples of simulations they have performed using `sequencing`.

## Acknowledging `sequencing`

If you used `sequencing` for work that was published in a journal article, preprint, blog post, etc., please cite/acknowledge the `sequencing` project using its DOI:

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/334427937.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/334427937)

## Uploading Examples

So that others may learn from and reproduce the results of your work, please consider uploading a demonstration of the simulations you performed in the form of well-documented Jupyter notebooks or Python files.

If you used `sequencing` to generate data that was included in a figure or table in a published document, explicitly point out which portions of the code reproduce which portions of the published work. Please also provide both a citation for the published work and a link to an open-access version (arXiv, link to a pdf, etc.).

For an example of a notebook that reproduces published work, see the [SNAP gate tutorial](https://sequencing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/07-snap-gate.html) ([link to notebook on GitHub](https://github.com/sequencing-dev/sequencing/blob/main/docs/source/notebooks/07-snap-gate.ipynb)).

## Workflow

1. Fork this repo on GitHub to your personal account.
2. Clone the repo from your fork.
3. Pull the latest changes from the `main` branch.
4. In your local repo, create a new directory in the root of the repo with a name describing the example.
5. Add your well-documented Jupyter notebook(s) and/or Python files to that directory.
6. Push your changes to *your* remote once the example is finished.
7. Create a pull request against the base ``main`` branch through the Github website.
